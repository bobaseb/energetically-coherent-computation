\section{Core Domains of Analysis}

The fundamental domains of anthropological inquiry - knowledge systems, power relations, ritual practice, and kinship organization - take on new significance when viewed through ECC's framework. Rather than treating these as separate spheres of cultural life, we can understand how they represent different manifestations of how human societies establish and maintain patterns of energetic coherence across individuals and groups.

Knowledge and power prove inherently linked through their grounding in patterns of energetic coherence. Foucault's insight about power/knowledge gains physical specificity through ECC - those who can shape and maintain particular patterns of coherence across social groups exercise genuine influence over collective experience and action. This explains both why knowledge systems prove remarkably stable across generations and how they remain open to transformation through shifts in practice.

Consider how traditional healing systems integrate practical knowledge, social authority, and ritual efficacy. Rather than choosing between symbolic and materialist interpretations, ECC suggests how healing practices work through establishing specific patterns of coherence that integrate multiple dimensions of experience. This explains both their genuine therapeutic effects and their resistance to reduction to either pure technique or cultural belief.

Ritual emerges as a sophisticated technology for establishing and maintaining patterns of coherence across social groups. Where earlier theories emphasized ritual's symbolic or functional aspects, ECC suggests how ritual practices work directly on patterns of energetic coherence through careful manipulation of attention, movement, and emotional arousal. This explains both ritual's remarkable stability across cultures and its capacity for generating profound personal and social transformation.

Victor Turner's concepts of liminality and communitas gain particular clarity through this lens \cite{turner1967forest}. Rather than treating these as purely social or psychological phenomena, we can understand how ritual creates conditions for establishing novel patterns of coherence that transcend ordinary social boundaries while remaining physically grounded.

Kinship systems represent fundamental ways that societies establish and maintain patterns of coherence across generations. Rather than treating kinship as either purely biological fact or arbitrary cultural construction, ECC suggests how kinship systems emerge from basic patterns of energetic coherence shaped by reproduction and alliance while enabling complex cultural elaboration. This explains both why certain kinship patterns recur across cultures and why societies can develop radically different but equally viable systems of relationship.
