  % Abstract: In this chapter, Ned Block compares three prominent frameworks for understanding consciousness that are widely considered by neuroscientists: (1) the view that consciousness is a biological state of the brain, (2) the global workspace theory, and (3) higher-order thought theories. He discusses how each framework addresses the "explanatory gap"—the challenge of explaining why specific neural processes correspond to particular conscious experiences. [Source: PhilPapers]
