  % Abstract: Global Workspace Theory (GWT) provides a framework for understanding conscious and unconscious brain events. It posits that consciousness involves the global broadcasting of information to multiple cognitive systems, facilitating functions such as perception, attention, and memory. Recent developments have expanded GWT to incorporate modern neuroscientific evidence, highlighting the role of the prefrontal cortex and other brain regions in conscious processing.

  % Abstract: How is it that thoroughly physical material beings such as ourselves can think, dream, feel, create and understand ideas, theories and concepts? An answer to this central question of our existence is emerging at the busy intersection of neuroscience, psychology, artificial intelligence, and robotics. In this groundbreaking work, philosopher and cognitive scientist Andy Clark explores exciting new theories from these fields that reveal minds like ours to be prediction machines—devices that have evolved to anticipate the incoming streams of sensory stimulation before they arrive. These predictions then initiate actions that structure our worlds and alter the very things we need to engage and predict. Clark takes us on a journey in discovering the circular causal flows and the self-structuring of the environment that define "the predictive brain." What emerges is a bold, new, cutting-edge vision that reveals the brain as our driving force in the daily surf through the waves of sensory stimulation.

This Review looks at some key brain theories in the biological (for example, neural Darwinism) and physical (for example, information theory and optimal control theory) sciences from the free-energy perspective. Crucially, one key theme runs through each of these theories—optimization. Furthermore, if we look closely at what is optimized, the same quantity keeps emerging, namely value (expected reward, expected utility) or its complement, surprise (prediction error, expected cost). This is the quantity that is optimized under the free-energy principle, which suggests that several global brain theories might be unified within a free-energy framework.

  % Abstract: "Predictive Coding under the Free-Energy Principle" by Karl Friston and Stefan Kiebel (2009) explores how the brain may perform prediction and perceptual categorization through hierarchical dynamical systems that model causal structures in sensory inputs. The authors propose that perception involves optimizing these internal models to explain sensory data, aligning with the free-energy principle, which suggests that the brain minimizes a free-energy function to reduce prediction errors. This framework provides a unifying perspective on neuronal mechanisms underlying top-down predictions and perceptual inference.
