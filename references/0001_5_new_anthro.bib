  author={Ingold, Tim},
  year={2011},
  publisher={Routledge},
  note={ISBN: 9780415576840}
  % Abstract: In "Being Alive," Tim Ingold presents a radically new understanding of movement, knowledge, and description as dimensions not just of being in the world, but of being alive to what is going on there. He explores themes such as the vitality of materials, the perception and formation of the ground, the mingling of earth and sky in the weather-world, and the role of storytelling in the integration of knowledge.

  % Abstract: Stevan Harnad addresses the challenge of how symbols in a formal system can acquire intrinsic meaning, rather than relying on external interpretation. He proposes that for symbols to be meaningful, they must be grounded in two types of non-symbolic representations: (1) "iconic representations," which are analogs of sensory perceptions, and (2) "categorical representations," which are learned or innate feature detectors that identify invariant features of object and event categories. This grounding allows for the emergence of symbolic representations that are intrinsically meaningful within the system.

  year={2016},

  % Abstract: In this article, I reconsider bio-essentialism in the study of kinship, centering on David Schneider's influential critique that concluded that kinship was "a non-subject" (1972:51). Schneider's critique is often taken to have shown the limitations of and problems with past views of kinship based on biology, genealogy, and reproduction, a critique that subsequently led those reworking kinship as relatedness in the new kinship studies to view their enterprise as divorced from such bio-essentialist studies. Beginning with an alternative narrative connecting kinship past and present and concluding by introducing a novel way of thinking about kinship, I have three constituent aims in this research article: (1) to reconceptualize the relationship between kinship past and kinship present; (2) to reevaluate Schneider's critique of bio-essentialism and what this implies for the contemporary study of kinship; and (3) subsequently to redirect theoretical discussion of what kinship is.

  % Abstract: In this classic book, Michael Taussig explores the social significance of the devil in the folklore of contemporary plantation workers and miners in South America. Grounding his analysis in Marxist theory, Taussig finds that the fetishization of evil, in the image of the devil, mediates the conflict between precapitalist and capitalist modes of objectifying the human condition. He links traditional narratives of the devil-pact, in which the soul is bartered for illusory or transitory power, with the way in which production in capitalist economies causes workers to become alienated from the commodities they produce.

  title={The Cunning of Recognition: Indigenous Alterities and the Making of Australian Multiculturalism},
  author={Povinelli, Elizabeth},
  year={2002},
  publisher={Duke University Press},
  note={ISBN: 9780822328681}
  % Abstract: Elizabeth A. Povinelli explores liberal multiculturalism from the perspective of Australian Indigenous social life. She argues that the multicultural legacy of colonialism perpetuates unequal systems of power by demanding that colonized subjects identify with an impossible standard of authentic traditional culture. Drawing on seventeen years of ethnographic research among northwest coast Indigenous people, Povinelli examines how multicultural forms of recognition work to reinforce liberal regimes rather than promote true cultural democracy.

  year={1991},
  publisher={Stanford University Press},
  note={ISBN: 9780804719698}
  % Abstract: Jacques Rancière presents the story of Joseph Jacotot, a French teacher who discovered in 1818 that an illiterate person could teach another illiterate person what he did not know himself. This led to the idea of "universal teaching," proposing that all people are equally intelligent and that anyone can teach anything to anyone else. Rancière uses this narrative to explore themes of education, emancipation, and the distribution of knowledge, challenging traditional hierarchies in the learning process.

  author={Malafouris, Lambros},
  year={2013},
  publisher={MIT Press},
  note={ISBN: 978-0262019194}
  % Abstract: Lambros Malafouris proposes Material Engagement Theory, a framework that adds materiality—the world of things, artifacts, and material signs—into the cognitive equation. He argues that the mind is not confined within the brain but is distributed across the tools and objects we interact with. Using various examples and case studies, Malafouris considers how these interactions have evolved from prehistory to the present, challenging conventional intuitions about the boundaries and location of the human mind.
