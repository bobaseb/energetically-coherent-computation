  % Abstract: This study analyzes the energy expenditure associated with excitatory signaling in the grey matter of the rodent brain. The authors estimate that action potentials and postsynaptic effects of glutamate consume the majority of energy (47% and 34%, respectively), while the resting potential accounts for 13%, and glutamate recycling uses only 3%. The findings suggest that energy usage is strongly influenced by action potential rates, with an increase of 1 action potential per cortical neuron per second raising oxygen consumption significantly. The study concludes that energy constraints favor the use of efficient neural codes and wiring patterns, predicting the utilization of distributed codes with up to 15% of neurons active simultaneously to optimize energy consumption and computational power. Functional magnetic resonance imaging signals are likely dominated by changes in energy usage associated with synaptic currents and action potential propagation.

  % Abstract: For half a century, the human brain was believed to contain about 100 billion neurons and one trillion glial cells, with a glia:neuron ratio of 10:1. A new counting method, the isotropic fractionator, has challenged the notion that glia outnumber neurons and revived a question that was widely thought to have been resolved. The recently validated isotropic fractionator demonstrates a glia:neuron ratio of less than 1:1 and a total number of less than 100 billion glial cells in the human brain. A survey of original evidence shows that histological data always supported a 1:1 ratio of glia to neurons in the entire human brain, and a range of 40-130 billion glial cells. We review how the claim of one trillion glial cells originated, was perpetuated, and eventually refuted. We compile how numbers of neurons and glial cells in the adult human brain were reported and we examine the reasons for an erroneous consensus about the relative abundance of glial cells in human brains that persisted for half a century. Our review includes a brief history of cell counting in human brains, types of counting methods that were and are employed, ranges of previous estimates, and the current status of knowledge about the number of cells. We also discuss implications and consequences of the new insights into true numbers of glial cells in the human brain, and the promise and potential impact of the newly validated isotropic fractionator for reliable quantification of glia and neurons in neurological and psychiatric diseases.

  % Abstract: Astrocytes have traditionally been considered ancillary, satellite cells of the nervous system. However, work over the past decade has revealed that they interact with the vasculature to form a gliovascular network that might organize not only the structural architecture of the brain but also its communication pathways, activation thresholds, and plasticity. The net effect is that astroglia demarcate gray matter regions, both cortical and subcortical, into functional compartments whose internal activation thresholds and external outputs are regulated by single glial cells. The array of these astrocyte-delimited microdomains along the capillary microvasculature allows the formation of higher-order gliovascular units, which serve to match local neural activity and blood flow while regulating neuronal firing thresholds through coordinative glial signaling. By these means, astrocytes might establish the functional as well as the structural architecture of the adult brain. [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14522144/)

It is thus not surprising that astrocytic morphology and function differ between regions, and that different subclasses of astrocytes exist within the same brain region. Recent lines of work also show that the complexity of protoplasmic astrocytes increases during evolution. Human astrocytes are structurally more complex, larger, and propagate calcium signals significantly faster than rodent astrocytes. In this chapter, we review the diversity of astrocytic form and function, while considering the markedly expanded roles of astrocytes with phylogenetic evolution.

New findings also support the view that the ECM is important for homeostatic processes, such as scaling of synaptic responses, metaplasticity and stabilization of synaptic connectivity. Activity-dependent modification of the ECM affects the formation of dendritic filopodia and the growth of dendritic spines. Thus, the ECM has a dual role as a promoter of structural and functional plasticity and as a degradable stabilizer of neural microcircuits. Both of these aspects are likely to be important for mental health. [Source: PubMed PMID: 20944663]

  % Abstract: Accumulating data support the importance of interactions between pre- and postsynaptic neuronal elements with astroglial processes and extracellular matrix (ECM) for formation and plasticity of chemical synapses, and thus validate the concept of a tetrapartite synapse. Here we outline the major mechanisms driving: (i) synaptogenesis by secreted extracellular scaffolding molecules, like thrombospondins (TSPs), neuronal pentraxins (NPs) and cerebellins, which respectively promote presynaptic, postsynaptic differentiation or both; (ii) maturation of synapses via reelin and integrin ligands-mediated signaling; and (iii) regulation of synaptic plasticity by ECM-dependent control of induction and consolidation of new synaptic configurations. Particularly, we focused on potential importance of activity-dependent concerted activation of multiple extracellular proteases, such as ADAMTS4/5/15, MMP9 and neurotrypsin, for permissive and instructive events in synaptic remodeling through localized degradation of perisynaptic ECM and generation of proteolytic fragments as inducers of synaptic plasticity.

The authors found that the effective diffusion coefficient for Ca2+ is lower than that for the monovalent cation tetramethylammonium (TMA+). Treatment with chondroitinase ABC, an enzyme that cleaves chondroitin sulfate glycans in the ECM, increased the diffusion coefficient for Ca2+ in both neocortex and hippocampus. This suggests that components of the ECM, particularly chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans, play a role in modulating Ca2+ diffusion, likely through electrostatic interactions.

  % Abstract: Diffusion in the extracellular space (ECS) of the brain is constrained by the volume fraction and the tortuosity, and a modified diffusion equation represents the transport behavior of many molecules in the brain. Deviations from the equation reveal loss of molecules across the blood-brain barrier, through cellular uptake, binding, or other mechanisms. Early diffusion measurements used radiolabeled sucrose and other tracers. Presently, the real-time iontophoresis (RTI) method is employed for small ions and the integrative optical imaging (IOI) method for fluorescent macromolecules, including dextrans or proteins. Theoretical models and simulations of the ECS have explored the influence of ECS geometry, effects of dead-space microdomains, extracellular matrix, and interaction of macromolecules with ECS channels. Extensive experimental studies with the RTI method employing the cation tetramethylammonium (TMA) in normal brain tissue show that the volume fraction of the ECS typically is approximately 20% and the tortuosity is approximately 1.6 (i.e., free diffusion coefficient of TMA is reduced by 2.6), although there are regional variations. These parameters change during development and aging. Diffusion properties have been characterized in several interventions, including brain stimulation, osmotic challenge, and knockout of extracellular matrix components. Measurements have also been made during ischemia, in models of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, and in human gliomas. Overall, these studies improve our conception of ECS structure and the roles of glia and extracellular matrix in modulating the ECS microenvironment. Knowledge of ECS diffusion properties is valuable in contexts ranging from understanding extrasynaptic volume transmission to the development of paradigms for drug delivery to the brain.

  % Abstract: Volume transmission is a form of intercellular communication that does not require synapses; it is based on the diffusion of neuroactive substances through the extracellular space (ECS) to their binding sites on neighboring neurons or glial cells. This type of signal transmission is crucial for the proper reaction of astrocytes to neuronal activity and their role in ionic, pH, and volume homeostasis, as well as for neuronal and glial network interactions involved in the regulation of neuronal transmission and plasticity. The review discusses the role of astrocytes and the extracellular matrix (ECM) in extrasynaptic volume transmission, highlighting how the ECS properties and its content, particularly the ECM, affect intercellular communication.

The analysis revealed that the density of axons within reach of dendritic spines did not predict synaptic density along dendrites, challenging Peters' rule. Additionally, axo-dendritic contacts did not consistently indicate synapses; however, the largest contact between an axonal bouton and a spine corresponded to actual synapses with about 80% precision, though this method missed approximately half of all synapses. These findings suggest that predicting synaptic connectivity requires detailed ultrastructural information to distinguish between mere contacts and true synapses. [Source: PubMed PMID: 20869597]

  note={DOI: 10.1146/annurev-neuro-070918-050421}
  % Abstract: Cortical interneurons display striking differences in shape, physiology, and other attributes, challenging us to appropriately classify them. We previously suggested that interneuron types should be defined by their role in cortical processing. Here, we revisit the question of how to codify their diversity based upon their division of labor and function as controllers of cortical information flow. We suggest that developmental trajectories provide a guide for appreciating interneuron diversity and argue that subtype identity is generated using a configurational (rather than combinatorial) code of transcription factors that produce attractor states in the underlying gene regulatory network. We present our updated three-stage model for interneuron specification: an initial cardinal step, allocating interneurons into a few major classes, followed by definitive refinement, creating subclasses upon settling within the cortex, and lastly, state determination, reflecting the incorporation of interneurons into functional circuit ensembles. We close by discussing findings indicating that major interneuron classes are both evolutionarily ancient and conserved. We propose that the complexity of cortical circuits is generated by phylogenetically old interneuron types, complemented by an evolutionary increase in principal neuron diversity. This suggests that a natural neurobiological definition of interneuron types might be derived from a match between their developmental origin and computational function.

  % Abstract: To understand the function of cortical circuits, it is necessary to catalog their cellular diversity. Past attempts to do so using anatomical, physiological, or molecular features of cortical cells have not resulted in a unified taxonomy of neuronal or glial cell types, partly due to limited data. Single-cell transcriptomics is enabling, for the first time, systematic high-throughput measurements of cortical cells and generation of datasets that hold the promise of being complete, accurate, and permanent. Statistical analyses of these data reveal clusters that often correspond to cell types previously defined by morphological or physiological criteria and that appear conserved across cortical areas and species. To capitalize on these new methods, we propose the adoption of a transcriptome-based taxonomy of cell types for the mammalian neocortex. This classification should be hierarchical and use a standardized nomenclature. It should be based on a probabilistic definition of a cell type and incorporate data from different approaches, developmental stages, and species. A community-based classification and data aggregation model, such as a knowledge graph, could provide a common foundation for the study of cortical circuits. This community-based classification, nomenclature, and data aggregation could serve as an example for cell type atlases in other parts of the body. [Source: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32839617/]

New high-throughput methods have created opportunities to address the technical challenges associated with neuronal classification by collecting comprehensive information about individual cells. Nonetheless, conceptual difficulties persist. Borrowing from the field of species taxonomy, we propose principles to be followed in the cell-type classification effort, including the incorporation of multiple, quantitative features as criteria, the use of discontinuous variation to define types, and the creation of a hierarchical system to represent relationships between cells. We review the progress of classifying cell types in the retina and cerebral cortex and propose a staged approach for moving forward with a systematic cell-type classification in the nervous system.

  % Abstract: Synaptic plasticity, the ability of neurons to change the number and strength of their synapses, has long been considered the sole province of the neuron. Yet neurons do not function in isolation; they are part of elaborate glial networks where they are intimately associated with astrocytes. Astrocytes make extensive contacts with synaptic sites where they release soluble factors that can increase synapse number, provide synaptic insulation restricting the spread of neurotransmitter to neighboring synapses, and release neuroactive compounds, gliotransmitters, that can directly influence synaptic transmission. During periods of synaptogenesis, astrocyte processes are highly mobile and may contribute to the stabilization of new synapses. As our understanding of the extent of their influence at the synapse unfolds, it is clear that astrocytes are well poised to modulate multiple aspects of synaptic plasticity.

  % Abstract: The ability to differentiate stimuli predicting positive or negative outcomes is critical for survival, and perturbations of emotional processing underlie many psychiatric disease states. Synaptic plasticity in the basolateral amygdala complex (BLA) mediates the acquisition of associative memories, both positive and negative. Different populations of BLA neurons may encode fearful or rewarding associations, but the identifying features of these populations and the synaptic mechanisms of differentiating positive and negative emotional valence have remained unknown. Here we show that BLA neurons projecting to the nucleus accumbens (NAc projectors) or the centromedial amygdala (CeM projectors) undergo opposing synaptic changes following fear or reward conditioning. We find that photostimulation of NAc projectors supports positive reinforcement while photostimulation of CeM projectors mediates negative reinforcement. Photoinhibition of CeM projectors impairs fear conditioning and enhances reward conditioning. We characterize these functionally distinct neuronal populations by comparing their electrophysiological, morphological and genetic features. Overall, we provide a mechanistic explanation for the representation of positive and negative associations within the amygdala.

  % Abstract: With advances in connectomics, transcriptome and neurophysiological technologies, the neuroscience of brain-wide neural circuits is poised to take off. A major challenge is to understand how a vast diversity of functions is subserved by parcellated areas of mammalian neocortex composed of repetitions of a canonical local circuit. Areas of the cerebral cortex differ from each other in not only their input-output patterns but also their biological properties. Recent experimental and theoretical work has revealed that such variations are not random heterogeneities; rather, synaptic excitation and inhibition display systematic macroscopic gradients across the entire cortex, and they are abnormal in mental illness. Quantitative differences along these gradients can lead to qualitatively novel behaviours in nonlinear neural dynamical systems, by virtue of a phenomenon mathematically described as bifurcation. The combination of macroscopic gradients and bifurcations, in tandem with biological evolution, development and plasticity, provides a generative mechanism for functional diversity among cortical areas, as a general principle of large-scale cortical organization.

For two-state folders, Φ is approximately 1. Several folding scenarios can be anticipated by considering variations in the energy landscape that depend on sequence, native topology, and external conditions.

  % Abstract: Many neurons in the mammalian central nervous system communicate through electrical synapses, defined here as gap junction-mediated connections. Electrical synapses are reciprocal pathways for ionic current and small organic molecules. They are often strong enough to mediate close synchronization of subthreshold and spiking activity among clusters of neurons. The most thoroughly studied electrical synapses occur between excitatory projection neurons of the inferior olivary nucleus and between inhibitory interneurons of the neocortex, hippocampus, and thalamus. All these synapses require the gap junction protein connexin36 (Cx36) for robust electrical coupling. Cx36 appears to interconnect neurons exclusively, and it is expressed widely along the mammalian neuraxis, implying that there are undiscovered electrical synapses throughout the central nervous system. Some central neurons may be electrically coupled by other connexin types or by pannexins, a newly described family of gap junction proteins. Electrical synapses are a ubiquitous yet underappreciated feature of neural circuits in the mammalian brain. [Source: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15217338/]

  % Abstract: Gap junctions are clustered channels between contacting cells through which direct intercellular communication via diffusion of ions and metabolites can occur. Two hemichannels, each built up of six connexin protein subunits in the plasma membrane of adjacent cells, can dock to each other to form conduits between cells. We have recently screened mouse and human genomic databases and have found 19 connexin (Cx) genes in the mouse genome and 20 connexin genes in the human genome. One mouse connexin gene and two human connexin genes do not appear to have orthologs in the other genome. With three exceptions, the characterized connexin genes comprise two exons whereby the complete reading frame is located on the second exon. Targeted ablation of eleven mouse connexin genes revealed basic insights into the functional diversity of the connexin gene family. In addition, the phenotypes of human genetic disorders caused by mutated connexin genes further complement our understanding of connexin functions in the human organism. In this review, we compare currently identified connexin genes in both the mouse and human genome and discuss the functions of gap junctions deduced from targeted mouse mutants and human genetic disorders.

  % Abstract: The lissencephaly gene LIS1 is crucial for proper brain development, particularly in neuronal migration. Mutations in LIS1 lead to lissencephaly, characterized by a smooth cerebral surface and severe neurological impairments. This review discusses LIS1's role in regulating cytoplasmic dynein function, affecting nuclear translocation during neuronal migration and mitosis. The authors highlight insights gained from LIS1 studies that enhance our understanding of cortical development and associated disorders.
