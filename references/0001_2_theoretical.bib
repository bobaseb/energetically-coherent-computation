  % Abstract: The mammalian cerebral cortex supports cognitive functions such as sensorimotor integration, memory, and social behaviors. Normal brain function relies on a diverse set of differentiated cell types, including neurons, glia, and vasculature. Here, we have used large-scale single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to classify cells in the mouse somatosensory cortex and hippocampal CA1 region. We found 47 molecularly distinct subclasses, comprising all known major cell types in the cortex. We identified numerous marker genes, which allowed alignment with known cell types, morphology, and location. We found a layer I interneuron expressing Pax6 and a distinct postmitotic oligodendrocyte subclass marked by Itpr2. Across the diversity of cortical cell types, transcription factors formed a complex, layered regulatory code, suggesting a mechanism for the maintenance of adult cell type identity.

  % Abstract: Aharonov and Bohm present a theoretical analysis demonstrating that electromagnetic potentials have a fundamental significance in quantum mechanics, even in regions where magnetic and electric fields are zero. They introduce what is now known as the Aharonov-Bohm effect, showing that particles are affected by electromagnetic potentials despite being confined to field-free regions, implying that potentials are more fundamental than fields in quantum theory.

  % Abstract: Functional brain imaging with positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging has been used extensively to map regional changes in brain activity. The signal used by both techniques is based on changes in local circulation and metabolism (brain work). Our understanding of the cell biology of these changes has progressed greatly in the past decade. New insights have emerged on the role of astrocytes in signal transduction as has an appreciation of the unique contribution of aerobic glycolysis to brain energy metabolism. Likewise, our understanding of the neurophysiologic processes responsible for imaging signals has progressed from an assumption that spiking activity (output) of neurons is most relevant to one focused on their input. Finally, neuroimaging, with its unique metabolic perspective, has alerted us to the ongoing and costly intrinsic activity within brain systems that most likely represents the largest fraction of the brain's functional activity.

  % Abstract: Computation is central to the foundations of modern cognitive science, but its role is controversial. Questions about computation abound: What is it for a physical system to implement a computation? Is computation sufficient for thought? What is the role of computation in a theory of cognition? What is the relation between different sorts of computational theory, such as connectionism and symbolic computation? In this paper, I develop a systematic framework that addresses all of these questions. [Source: https://consc.net/papers/computation.html]

  publisher={Stanford University},
  note={Available at \url{https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/church-turing/}}
  % Abstract: This article provides an in-depth analysis of the Church-Turing Thesis, which posits that any function that can be computed by an algorithm can be computed by a Turing machine. It explores the historical development of the thesis, its formalization, and its implications in the fields of computer science and philosophy. The article also discusses various interpretations and critiques of the thesis, providing a comprehensive overview of its significance and limitations.

  author={Deutsch, David},
  year={2011},
  publisher={Allen Lane},
  address={London},
  note={ISBN: 978-0-713-99918-1}
  % Abstract: In this book, David Deutsch argues that explanations have a fundamental place in the universe and that improving them is the basic regulating principle not only of science but also of all successful human endeavor. He explores the nature of knowledge and its potential for infinite growth, discussing topics ranging from the theory of computation to the multiverse interpretation of quantum physics. Deutsch contends that the quest for good explanations drives the advancement of civilization and that problems are inevitable but always solvable, leading to unbounded progress.

  year={1981},
  note={DOI: 10.1038/scientificamerican0181-114}
  % Abstract: In this article, Jerry A. Fodor examines the mind-body problem, which concerns the relationship between mental states and physical processes. He discusses various philosophical perspectives, including dualism and materialism, and analyzes the challenges of explaining how mental phenomena such as beliefs, desires, and intentions can arise from physical brain processes. Fodor also explores the implications of cognitive science research for understanding the mind-body relationship and the prospects for developing a comprehensive theory that integrates mental and physical explanations.

  % Abstract: Information is inevitably tied to physical representation and transmission. This paper discusses the physical nature of information, emphasizing that information is not a disembodied abstract entity but has physical consequences. The processing of information requires physical systems, and understanding the physical limitations and implications is crucial for the development of future technologies.

  % Abstract: Searle critically examines the analogy between the brain and digital computers, arguing that while computers manipulate symbols based on syntactic rules, human brains produce consciousness and understanding through biological processes. He contends that computational models cannot fully explain human cognition, as they lack intrinsic intentionality and understanding.

He discusses the foundational question of "How come existence?" and presents conclusions that challenge traditional views, such as the idea that the world cannot be understood as a giant machine governed by pre-established physical laws. Wheeler introduces the concept that every physical quantity derives its significance from binary yes-or-no indications, encapsulated in the phrase "it from bit."
