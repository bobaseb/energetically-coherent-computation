  % Abstract: The embodied and situated approach to artificial intelligence (AI) has matured and become a viable alternative to traditional computationalist approaches with respect to the practical goal of building artificial agents that can behave in a robust and flexible manner under changing real-world conditions. Nevertheless, some concerns have recently been raised with regard to the sufficiency of current embodied AI for advancing our scientific understanding of intentional agency. While from an engineering or computer science perspective this limitation might not be relevant, it is of course highly relevant for AI researchers striving to build accurate models of natural cognition. We argue that the biological foundations of enactive cognitive science can provide the conceptual tools that are needed to diagnose more clearly the shortcomings of current embodied AI. In particular, taking an enactive perspective points to the need for AI to take seriously the organismic roots of autonomous agency and sense-making. We identify two necessary systemic requirements, namely constitutive autonomy and adaptivity, which lead us to introduce two design principles of enactive AI. It is argued that the development of such enactive AI poses a significant challenge to current methodologies. However, it also provides a promising way of eventually overcoming the current limitations of embodied AI, especially in terms of providing fuller models of natural embodied cognition. Finally, some practical implications and examples of the two design principles of enactive AI are also discussed.

  % Abstract: "Molecular Computing: The Lock-Key Paradigm" is a concept that explores the potential of using molecular interactions, specifically the lock-and-key mechanism, as a basis for computation. This paradigm draws inspiration from biological systems, where molecules interact with high specificity, akin to a key fitting into a lock. By harnessing these interactions, it's possible to design molecular systems that perform logical operations, forming the foundation of molecular computing. In this context, molecules can be engineered to function as logic gates, the fundamental building blocks of digital circuits. For instance, certain molecules can exhibit changes in their fluorescence properties in response to specific chemical inputs, effectively performing logical operations such as AND, OR, and NOT gates. These molecular logic gates have potential applications in areas like biosensing, where they can detect the presence of specific ions or molecules, and in the development of advanced nanomachines capable of processing information at the molecular level. The lock-and-key model, traditionally used to describe enzyme-substrate interactions, serves as a foundational concept in this paradigm. However, recent studies suggest that this model may need refinement to account for the role of solvent molecules in binding processes. Interactions mediated through solvents can significantly influence the Gibbs energy of binding, indicating that the traditional lock-and-key model might require adjustments to fully explain molecular recognition phenomena.

  % Abstract: Whether current or near-term AI systems could be conscious is a topic of scientific interest and increasing public concern. This report argues for, and exemplifies, a rigorous and empirically grounded approach to AI consciousness: assessing existing AI systems in detail, in light of our best-supported neuroscientific theories of consciousness. We survey several prominent scientific theories of consciousness, including recurrent processing theory, global workspace theory, higher-order theories, predictive processing, and attention schema theory. From these theories we derive "indicator properties" of consciousness, elucidated in computational terms that allow us to assess AI systems for these properties. We use these indicator properties to assess several recent AI systems, and we discuss how future systems might implement them. Our analysis suggests that no current AI systems are conscious, but also suggests that there are no obvious technical barriers to building AI systems which satisfy these indicators.

  publisher={Elsevier}
  % Abstract: "An RNA-Based Theory of Natural Universal Computation" is a 2022 paper by Hessameddin Akhlaghpour, published in the Journal of Theoretical Biology. The study proposes that RNA molecules, through specific editing rules, can perform computations equivalent to those of a Turing machine, suggesting that universal computation is achievable within molecular biology. Akhlaghpour's model bridges concepts from combinatory logic and RNA molecular biology, demonstrating that a set of basic RNA editing operations—such as cleavage and ligation at fixed positions relative to predefined motifs—can compute any function computable by a Turing machine. This implies that life may have evolved, or even originated with, an RNA-based universal computer that remains to be discovered. The paper suggests that this RNA-based computation system could solve various computational problems across multiple biological scales, including memory, cognition, development, disease, evolution, and the early stages of life. Experimental validation of this theory could significantly impact our understanding of these areas.
