  % Abstract: György Buzsáki challenges the traditional "outside-in" approach to understanding brain function, which focuses on how external stimuli shape neural responses. Instead, he proposes an "inside-out" perspective, emphasizing the brain's intrinsic activity and its role in generating actions to predict and interpret sensory inputs. This framework suggests that the brain is a proactive explorer, constantly testing hypotheses through action to create meaning.

  note = {DOI: 10.1038/nature12517}
  % Abstract: The complexity of the human brain has made it difficult to study many brain disorders in model organisms, highlighting the need for an in vitro model of human brain development. Here we have developed a human pluripotent stem cell-derived three-dimensional organoid culture system, termed cerebral organoids, that develop various discrete, although interdependent, brain regions. These include a cerebral cortex containing progenitor populations that organize and produce mature cortical neuron subtypes. Furthermore, cerebral organoids are shown to recapitulate features of human cortical development, namely characteristic progenitor zone organization with abundant outer radial glial stem cells. Finally, we use RNA interference and patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells to model microcephaly, a disorder that has been difficult to recapitulate in mice. We demonstrate premature neuronal differentiation in patient organoids, a defect that could help to explain the disease phenotype. Together, these data show that three-dimensional organoids can recapitulate development and disease even in this most complex human tissue.

  % Abstract: This book is devoted to the slime mould Physarum polycephalum, a large single cell capable of distributed sensing, concurrent information processing, parallel computation, and decentralized actuation. The ease of culturing and experimenting with Physarum makes it an ideal substrate for real-world implementations of unconventional sensing and computing devices. The book presents theoretical and experimental studies on the sensing and computing properties of slime mould, and the development of mathematical and logical theories of Physarum behavior. It demonstrates how to create logical gates and circuits, electronic devices (memristors, diodes, transistors, wires, chemical and tactile sensors) with the slime mould, and how to modify properties of Physarum computing circuits with functional nanoparticles and polymers. The book also explores interfacing the slime mould with field-programmable arrays and using Physarum as a controller of microbial fuel cells. A unique multi-agent model of slime is shown to serve as a software slime mould capable of solving problems of computational geometry and graph optimization. The book is a comprehensive treatise that will inspire scientists, engineers, and artists to exploit natural phenomena in the design of future and emergent computing and sensing devices.

  % Abstract: This study presents practical methods for measuring integrated information (a key concept in Integrated Information Theory) from time-series data. The authors develop and evaluate algorithms to estimate integrated information in simulated neural systems, providing tools for empirical research on the neural correlates of consciousness. They discuss the challenges and limitations of these measures and suggest directions for future improvements.
