Using real-time assessments and two-photon imaging in live mice, they show that natural sleep or anesthesia is associated with a 60% increase in interstitial space, leading to enhanced convective exchange of cerebrospinal fluid with interstitial fluid. This process increases the rate of β-amyloid clearance during sleep, suggesting that one restorative function of sleep is the removal of potentially neurotoxic waste products that accumulate during wakefulness.

They found that during non-rapid eye movement sleep, the initial response to stimulation was stronger but rapidly extinguished and did not propagate beyond the stimulation site. This suggests that the fading of consciousness during certain stages of sleep may be related to a breakdown in cortical effective connectivity. [Source: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16195466/]

  % Abstract: This study demonstrates that attending to surprising tactile changes recruits a hierarchic ensemble of sensory, salience, and attention-related cortical areas. The results illuminate the role of the anterior insular cortex (AIC) in coordinating hierarchical processing of surprising tactile stimuli. The findings suggest that the AIC coordinates dynamic interactions between these disparate neural processes, potentially via monitoring and modulating precision, thereby anchoring the "global neuronal workspace" theory of consciousness in an embodied network of sensory predictions.

Here I analyze how the numbers of neurons in the cerebral cortex and cerebellum scale across 19 species of primates and insectivores. I find that the numbers of neurons in the cerebral cortex and cerebellum scale coordinately, such that the cerebral cortex gains approximately 3.6 neurons for every neuron added to the cerebellum. This relationship holds across species despite variations in brain size and structure, suggesting a conserved scaling mechanism that may reflect functional connectivity between these two brain regions.

He examines a worldwide corpus of data, including his own fieldwork in West Africa, and develops a typology of trance based on symbolism and external manifestations. Rouget analyzes music in terms of performers, practices, instruments, and associations with dance, concluding that each kind of trance draws strength from music in different ways at different points in a ritual. He forcefully rejects pseudo-science and reductionism, demystifying the so-called theory of the neurophysiological effects of drumming on trance, and concludes that music's physiological and emotional effects are inseparable from patterns of collective representations and behavior.

  % Abstract: Studies investigating developmental synaesthesia have sought to describe a number of qualities that might capture in behavioural terms the defining characteristics of this unusual phenomenon. The task of generating a definition is made more difficult by the fact that any description of synaesthesia must be broad enough to capture the 61 different variants of the condition already reported to date. Given these difficulties, the current literature now contains a number of conflicting assumptions about the nature of this condition. Here, I attempt to address several of these divisive areas from a set of contemporary definitions. I present evidence that might argue against previous claims that synaesthesia is (a) a 'merging of the senses', which (b) gives rise to consistent synaesthetic associations over time, with (c) synaesthetic associations that are spatially extended. I then investigate the possible benefits of moving from a behavioural definition to a neurobiological one and explore the ways in which this might force a rethink about the potential outermost boundaries of this fascinating condition.

He argues that perception, action, and cognition are best understood as processes involving the brain's constant attempts to minimize prediction errors. This perspective emphasizes the embodied nature of mind, suggesting that our sensory and motor systems are deeply intertwined in the brain's predictive mechanisms.

  % Abstract: Antonio Damasio examines the relationship between emotion and consciousness, proposing that emotions are integral to the development of self-awareness. He introduces the concept of the "proto-self," a non-conscious state representing the body's internal milieu, and discusses how emotions arise from the brain's mapping of bodily states. Damasio argues that consciousness emerges when the brain constructs a narrative linking the proto-self with external objects and events, highlighting the foundational role of the body in shaping the mind.

  % Abstract: Objective: To validate the current criteria of visual snow and to describe its common phenotype using a substantial clinical database. Methods: We performed a web-based survey of patients with self-assessed visual snow (n = 1,104), with either the complete visual snow syndrome (n = 1,061) or visual snow without the syndrome (n = 43). We also describe a population of patients (n = 70) with possible hallucinogen persisting perception disorder who presented clinically with visual snow syndrome. Results: The visual snow population had an average age of 29 years and had no sex prevalence. The disorder usually started in early life, and ≈40% of patients had symptoms for as long as they could remember. The most commonly experienced static was black and white. Floaters, afterimages, and photophobia were the most reported additional visual symptoms. A latent class analysis showed that visual snow does not present with specific clinical endophenotypes. Conclusions: Clinical characteristics of visual snow did not differ from the previous cohort in the literature, supporting validity of the current criteria. Visual snow likely represents a clinical continuum, with different degrees of severity. On the severe end of the spectrum, it is more likely to present with its common comorbid conditions, migraine and tinnitus. Visual snow does not depend on the effect of psychotropic substances on the brain. [Source: PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31941797/)

  % Abstract: Anil K. Seth proposes a theory integrating predictive processing with sensorimotor contingencies to explain perceptual presence—the sense of objects as real and present in the environment. He argues that perceptual experience arises from the brain's predictions about sensory inputs and their potential changes due to actions. This framework accounts for the vividness of perception in normal cases and its diminution in conditions like synesthesia, where such predictive models may be less robust.

  % Abstract: Our understanding of the neural correlates of pain perception in humans has increased significantly since the advent of neuroimaging. Relating neural activity changes to the varied pain experiences has led to an increased awareness of how factors (e.g., cognition, emotion, context, injury) can separately influence pain perception. Tying this body of knowledge in humans to work in animal models of pain provides an opportunity to determine common features that reliably contribute to pain perception and its modulation. One key system that underpins the ability to change pain intensity is the brainstem's descending modulatory network with its pro- and antinociceptive components. We discuss not only the latest data describing the cerebral signature of pain and its modulation in humans, but also suggest that the brainstem plays a pivotal role in gating the degree of nociceptive transmission so that the resultant pain experienced is appropriate for the particular situation of the individual.

It is therefore not exclusively driven by the noxious input. Attentional modulation involving the descending pain modulatory system has been examined extensively in neuroimaging studies. However, the investigation of neural mechanisms underlying more complex cognitive modulation is an emerging field in pain research. Recent findings indicate an engagement of the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex during more complex modulation, leading to a change or reappraisal of the emotional significance of pain. Taking placebo-induced analgesia as an example, we discuss the contribution of attention, expectation and reappraisal as three basic mechanisms that are important for the cognitive modulation of pain.

  % Abstract: Richard J. Davidson, in collaboration with Sharon Begley, presents a framework for understanding how six emotional styles—Resilience, Outlook, Social Intuition, Self-Awareness, Sensitivity to Context, and Attention—shape our responses to experiences. Drawing on decades of research, Davidson discusses how these styles are rooted in specific brain circuits and how they influence our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. The book also offers strategies for reshaping these emotional styles to enhance well-being. [Source: https://www.pmi.org/learning/library/emotional-life-projects-neuroscience-emotions-6046]

He critiques the narrow view of language implicit in current BBI conceptions and proposes an alternative perspective that emphasizes language's role in organizing joint agency. Dingemanse highlights two crucial features of language: its selectivity, which provides filters between public words and private thoughts, and its negotiability, which offers opportunities for calibrating understanding and expressing consent or dissent. He argues that without these features, BBIs risk reducing human interaction to a level comparable to that of simple organisms, but with them, BBIs could become useful extensions of human agency.

  % Abstract: This study investigates the color vision of female carriers of anomalous trichromacy, who possess four types of photopigments due to X-chromosome inactivation. The research examines whether these carriers exhibit tetrachromatic color vision, potentially allowing them to perceive a broader range of colors than typical trichromats. Psychophysical tests were conducted to assess their color discrimination abilities.

  % Abstract: This research investigates the tetrachromatic color vision of birds, focusing on the female zebra finch. The study examines how the presence of a fourth type of photoreceptor enables these birds to perceive ultraviolet light, which plays a crucial role in mate selection and other behaviors. Behavioral experiments demonstrate the functional significance of tetrachromacy in avian species.

  % Abstract: The visual pigments of vertebrates evolved about 500 million years ago, before the major evolutionary step of the development of jaws. Four spectrally distinct classes of cone opsin evolved through gene duplication, followed by the rod opsin class that arose from the duplication of the middle-wave-sensitive cone opsin. All four cone classes are present in many extant teleost fish, reptiles, and birds, but one or more classes have been lost in primitive fish, amphibians, and mammals. [Source: PubMed]

  % Abstract: This paper critically examines color relationalism and color relativism, two theories of color that are allegedly supported by variation in normal human color vision. The authors mostly discuss color relationalism, defended at length in Jonathan Cohen's "The Red and the Real," and argue that the theory has insuperable problems. [Source: PubMed]

  % Abstract: The relations among consciousness, brain, behavior, and scientific explanation are explored in the domain of color perception. Current scientific knowledge about color similarity, color composition, dimensional structure, unique colors, and color categories is used to assess Locke's "inverted spectrum argument" about the undetectability of color transformations. A symmetry analysis of color space shows that the literal interpretation of this argument—reversing the experience of a rainbow—would not work. [Source: PubMed]

  % Abstract: This is the first half of a two-part paper dealing with the geometry of color perception. Here, the seminal 1974 work by H.L. Resnikoff is analyzed in detail, showing that there are only two possible geometric structures and Riemannian metrics on the perceived color space compatible with Schrödinger's axioms and the hypothesis of homogeneity. The study recasts Resnikoff's model into a modern colorimetric setting, providing a simpler proof of the main result and motivating the need for psychophysical experiments to confirm or refute the model.

  % Abstract: In this philosophical thought experiment, Block introduces the concept of "Inverted Earth," a hypothetical scenario where the color experiences of an individual are systematically inverted without their awareness. This scenario is used to explore issues related to functionalism, representationalism, and the nature of qualitative experience (qualia), challenging the notion that mental states can be fully explained by their functional roles or representational content.
