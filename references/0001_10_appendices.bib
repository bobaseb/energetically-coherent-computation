The findings revealed that these networks support efficient parallel information transfer at relatively low cost. However, efficiency was disproportionately reduced in older individuals, particularly in frontal and temporal regions. Additionally, pharmacological blockade of dopamine transmission impaired network efficiency, with distinct localization patterns.

  pages={65--72},
  year={2017},
  note={DOI: 10.1016/j.conb.2017.09.011}
  % Abstract: Brain activity during wakefulness is associated with high metabolic rates that are believed to support information processing and memory encoding. In spite of loss of consciousness, sleep still carries a substantial energy cost. Experimental evidence supports a cerebral metabolic shift taking place during sleep that suppresses aerobic glycolysis, a hallmark of environment-oriented waking behavior and synaptic plasticity. Recent studies reveal that glial astrocytes respond to the reduction of wake-promoting neuromodulators by regulating volume, composition and glymphatic drainage of interstitial fluid. These events are accompanied by changes in neuronal discharge patterns, astrocyte-neuron interactions, synaptic transactions and underlying metabolic features. Internally-generated neuronal activity and network homeostasis are proposed to account for the high sleep-related energy demand. [Source: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29024871/]

  % Abstract: Transport phenomena are fundamental in physics, facilitating the exchange of information and energy in systems ranging from communication networks to biological entities. While environmental noise typically hinders transport efficiency, this study demonstrates that, counterintuitively, local dephasing noise can enhance the transport of excitations across dissipative quantum networks, even at zero temperature. The authors elucidate the underlying mechanisms, note that entanglement does not play a supportive role, and propose potential experimental demonstrations in quantum optics. They also suggest that nature may exploit this effect, as evidenced by noise-assisted excitation transport in light-harvesting molecules. These findings open avenues for designing optimized transport structures, such as artificial nanostructures, that benefit from noise assistance. [Source: https://arxiv.org/abs/0807.4902]

  publisher={Routledge},
  note={ISBN: 978-0415228329}
  % Abstract: Tim Ingold offers a persuasive new approach to understanding how human beings perceive their surroundings. He argues that what we are used to calling cultural variation consists, in the first place, of variations in skill. Neither innate nor acquired, skills are grown, incorporated into the human organism through practice and training in an environment. They are thus as much biological as cultural. To account for the generation of skills we have therefore to understand the dynamics of development. And this in turn calls for an ecological approach that situates practitioners in the context of an active engagement with the constituents of their surroundings.
