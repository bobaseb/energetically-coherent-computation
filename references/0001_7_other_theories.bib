  % Abstract: Global Workspace Theory (GWT) provides a framework for understanding conscious and unconscious brain events. It posits that consciousness involves the global broadcasting of information to multiple cognitive systems, facilitating functions such as perception, attention, and memory. Recent developments have expanded GWT to incorporate modern neuroscientific evidence, highlighting the role of the prefrontal cortex and other brain regions in conscious processing.

  % Abstract: How is it that thoroughly physical material beings such as ourselves can think, dream, feel, create and understand ideas, theories and concepts? An answer to this central question of our existence is emerging at the busy intersection of neuroscience, psychology, artificial intelligence, and robotics. In this groundbreaking work, philosopher and cognitive scientist Andy Clark explores exciting new theories from these fields that reveal minds like ours to be prediction machines—devices that have evolved to anticipate the incoming streams of sensory stimulation before they arrive. These predictions then initiate actions that structure our worlds and alter the very things we need to engage and predict. Clark takes us on a journey in discovering the circular causal flows and the self-structuring of the environment that define "the predictive brain." What emerges is a bold, new, cutting-edge vision that reveals the brain as our driving force in the daily surf through the waves of sensory stimulation.

This Review looks at some key brain theories in the biological (for example, neural Darwinism) and physical (for example, information theory and optimal control theory) sciences from the free-energy perspective. Crucially, one key theme runs through each of these theories—optimization. Furthermore, if we look closely at what is optimized, the same quantity keeps emerging, namely value (expected reward, expected utility) or its complement, surprise (prediction error, expected cost). This is the quantity that is optimized under the free-energy principle, which suggests that several global brain theories might be unified within a free-energy framework.

  % Abstract: "Predictive Coding under the Free-Energy Principle" by Karl Friston and Stefan Kiebel (2009) explores how the brain may perform prediction and perceptual categorization through hierarchical dynamical systems that model causal structures in sensory inputs. The authors propose that perception involves optimizing these internal models to explain sensory data, aligning with the free-energy principle, which suggests that the brain minimizes a free-energy function to reduce prediction errors. This framework provides a unifying perspective on neuronal mechanisms underlying top-down predictions and perceptual inference.

  % Abstract: In "The Predictive Mind," Jakob Hohwy explores the idea that the brain is essentially a hypothesis-testing mechanism, constantly predicting sensory inputs and updating its beliefs based on the errors of these predictions. This framework, known as predictive coding, offers a unifying account of perception, action, and cognition, suggesting that our experiences are shaped by the brain's attempts to minimize prediction errors.

  % Abstract: Binocular rivalry occurs when the eyes are presented with different stimuli and subjective perception alternates between them. This review takes an epistemological approach, considering the brain as engaged in probabilistic unconscious perceptual inference about the causes of its sensory input. The authors describe a simple empirical Bayesian framework, implemented with predictive coding, capable of explaining binocular rivalry and reconciling many findings. The core explanation is that selection and alternation between stimuli occur when there is no single model about the causes in the environment that enjoys both high likelihood and high prior probability. Dominance of one stimulus leads to the bottom-up signal for the suppressed stimulus remaining as an unexplained prediction error signal, inducing instability in perceptual dynamics and giving rise to perceptual alternations during rivalry.

These predictions attempt to match the incoming sensory input, and the discrepancies (prediction errors) are sent back through feedforward connections. This predictive coding framework accounts for various extra-classical receptive-field effects observed in the visual cortex, suggesting that the brain continuously generates and updates predictions of sensory inputs to efficiently process visual information.

He argues that the brain's predictions about the sensory consequences of actions (sensorimotor contingencies) contribute to this sense of presence. The theory also offers insights into synesthesia, where atypical sensorimotor predictions may lead to unusual perceptual experiences.

  % Abstract: Building upon his previous work, Penrose delves deeper into the relationship between consciousness and physics. He introduces the concept of "objective reduction" (OR), a form of wavefunction collapse, and collaborates with anesthesiologist Stuart Hameroff to propose the orchestrated objective reduction (Orch OR) theory. This theory posits that quantum processes within the brain's microtubules contribute to consciousness, challenging conventional computational theories of mind.

  % Abstract: Tegmark examines the feasibility of quantum coherence playing a significant role in brain function. He calculates decoherence timescales for neural processes and finds them to be extremely short—on the order of 10^-13 to 10^-20 seconds—much shorter than the timescales of neural firing (milliseconds). This rapid decoherence suggests that quantum effects are unlikely to be relevant for cognitive processes, supporting the view that the brain operates effectively as a classical system.

  % Abstract: The study investigates how bioelectric fields contribute to the formation of memory networks, known as engram complexes. The authors provide evidence that ephaptic (non-synaptic) coupling via these fields helps coordinate neural activity across different brain regions, facilitating memory formation and consolidation.

  % Abstract: This article proposes the Cytoelectric Coupling Hypothesis, suggesting that electric fields generated by neuronal activity influence the brain's structural framework down to the cytoskeletal level. The authors argue that these fields play a role in organizing neural ensembles and optimizing the brain's infrastructure for efficient information processing.

  % Abstract: This study models mesoscopic ephaptic (non-synaptic) interactions in the human brain using realistic finite element modeling. The authors find that endogenous electric fields generated by neuronal activity are comparable in magnitude to those produced by noninvasive brain stimulation techniques and can modulate neuronal activity. They also observe that ephaptic coupling decreases with age, particularly in sensorimotor and medial brain regions. [Source: PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32479496/)

  % Abstract: The authors investigate the role of ephaptic coupling—communication between neurons via electric fields—in enhancing brain complexity. Using the Multiscale Entropy methodology, they analyze neural network responses and find that ephaptic interactions increase complexity under specific topological conditions, considering variables such as time, spatial scales, and synaptic intensity. These findings suggest that ephaptic coupling plays a fundamental role in regulating complex brain functions. [Source: PubMed Central](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11620465/)

  % Abstract: This paper presents a cable theory framework to study how neurons generate extracellular electric fields (Ve) and how these fields influence membrane potentials (Vm) through ephaptic interactions. The authors find that while these interactions are small, they are not negligible. In a case study of the medial superior olive (MSO) in the auditory brainstem, they demonstrate that ephaptic interactions can modulate spike initiation thresholds, spike timing synchrony, and sensitivity to time differences, suggesting a potential role in auditory processing.
