  % Abstract: Neural network training relies on our ability to find "good" minimizers of highly non-convex loss functions. It is well-known that certain network architecture designs (e.g., skip connections) produce loss functions that train easier, and well-chosen training parameters (batch size, learning rate, optimizer) produce minimizers that generalize better. However, the reasons for these differences, and their effects on the underlying loss landscape, are not well understood. In this paper, we explore the structure of neural loss functions, and the effect of loss landscapes on generalization, using a range of visualization methods. First, we introduce a simple "filter normalization" method that helps us visualize loss function curvature and make meaningful side-by-side comparisons between loss functions. Then, using a variety of visualizations, we explore how network architecture affects the loss landscape, and how training parameters affect the shape of minimizers.

  author={Kukushkin, NV and Carney, RE and Tabassum, T and Carew, TJ},
  journal={Nature Communications},
  volume={15},
  number={1},
  pages={9635},
  year={2024},
  publisher={Nature Publishing Group UK London}
  % Abstract: The massed-spaced effect, a hallmark of memory formation, is demonstrated in two non-neural, immortalized cell lines expressing a luciferase reporter controlled by a CREB-dependent promoter. Four spaced pulses of agonists elicit stronger and more sustained luciferase expression than a single massed pulse, with corresponding activation of ERK and CREB. Inhibition of ERK or CREB blocks this effect, indicating that canonical features of memory can be embedded in signaling cascades conserved across different cell types.
