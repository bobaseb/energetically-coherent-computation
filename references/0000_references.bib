  % Abstract: Neural network training relies on our ability to find "good" minimizers of highly non-convex loss functions. It is well-known that certain network architecture designs (e.g., skip connections) produce loss functions that train easier, and well-chosen training parameters (batch size, learning rate, optimizer) produce minimizers that generalize better. However, the reasons for these differences, and their effects on the underlying loss landscape, are not well understood. In this paper, we explore the structure of neural loss functions, and the effect of loss landscapes on generalization, using a range of visualization methods. First, we introduce a simple "filter normalization" method that helps us visualize loss function curvature and make meaningful side-by-side comparisons between loss functions. Then, using a variety of visualizations, we explore how network architecture affects the loss landscape, and how training parameters affect the shape of minimizers.

  author={Kukushkin, NV and Carney, RE and Tabassum, T and Carew, TJ},
  journal={Nature Communications},
  volume={15},
  number={1},
  pages={9635},
  year={2024},
  publisher={Nature Publishing Group UK London}
  % Abstract: The massed-spaced effect, a hallmark of memory formation, is demonstrated in two non-neural, immortalized cell lines expressing a luciferase reporter controlled by a CREB-dependent promoter. Four spaced pulses of agonists elicit stronger and more sustained luciferase expression than a single massed pulse, with corresponding activation of ERK and CREB. Inhibition of ERK or CREB blocks this effect, indicating that canonical features of memory can be embedded in signaling cascades conserved across different cell types.

  % Abstract: Harold Saxton Burr was a biologist working throughout the 1930s–1950s on an important set of problems related to biological organization and the origin of complex living forms. He was a profound thinker, suggesting a complementary focus on field concepts in addition to the emphasis on particle models and integrating concepts from physics and philosophy in his work. He developed innovations in electrophysiological technique and used them to perform a wide experimental survey of bioelectricity in normal and pathological growth. Here, I briefly review his classic paper with philosopher F. S. C. Northrop, “The Electro-Dynamic Theory of Life,” in the context of advances in this field over the last few decades. Based on recent progress, it is now clear that Burr was a prescient and visionary thinker. His main hypothesis, that bioelectric gradients serve as prepatterns guiding morphogenesis, has been confirmed using modern molecular physiology, as have his ideas about the place of cancer and the nervous system in the question of biological organization. With limited technology but deep insight, he derived insights that anticipated many modern discoveries. Even more importantly, Burr’s view of bioelectricity as a convenient entry point for rigorous investigation of the broader question of self-organizing properties of life highlights a frontier of inquiry that awaits today’s researchers. Burr and Northrop’s “The Electro-Dynamic Theory of Life,” originally published in the Quarterly Review of Biology (10(3):322–333, 1935), is available as supplementary material in the online version of this essay.

  % Abstract: We propose and present converging evidence for the Cytoelectric Coupling Hypothesis: Electric fields generated by neurons are causal down to the level of the cytoskeleton. This could be achieved via electrodiffusion and mechanotransduction and exchanges between electrical, potential and chemical energy. Ephaptic coupling organizes neural activity, forming neural ensembles at the macroscale level. This information propagates to the neuron level, affecting spiking, and down to molecular level to stabilize the cytoskeleton, “tuning” it to process information more efficiently.

Here, we test the hypothesis that engram complexes are formed in part by bioelectric fields that sculpt and guide the neural activity and tie together the areas that participate in engram complexes. Like the conductor of an orchestra, the fields influence each musician or neuron and orchestrate the output, the symphony. Our results use the theory of synergetics, machine learning, and data from a spatial delayed saccade task and provide evidence for in vivo ephaptic coupling in memory representations.

  journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:2409.20318},
  year={2024}
  % Abstract: In the context of consciousness studies, a key challenge is how to rigorously conceptualise first-person phenomenological descriptions of lived experience and their relation to third-person empirical measurements of the activity or dynamics of the brain and body. Since the 1990s, there has been a coordinated effort to explicitly combine first-person phenomenological methods, generating qualitative data, with neuroscientific techniques used to describe and quantify brain activity under the banner of "neurophenomenology". Here, we take on this challenge and develop an approach to neurophenomenology from a mathematical perspective. We harness recent advances in theoretical neuroscience and the physics of cognitive systems to mathematically conceptualise first-person experience and its correspondence with neural and behavioural dynamics. Throughout, we make the operating assumption that the content of first-person experience can be formalised as (or related to) a belief (i.e. a probability distribution) that encodes an organism's best guesses about the state of its external and internal world (e.g. body or brain) as well as its uncertainty. We mathematically characterise phenomenology, bringing to light a tool-set to quantify individual phenomenological differences and develop several hypotheses including on the metabolic cost of phenomenology and on the subjective experience of time. We conceptualise the form of the generative passages between first- and third-person descriptions, and the mathematical apparatus that mutually constrains them, as well as future research directions. In summary, we formalise and characterise first-person subjective experience and its correspondence with third-person empirical measurements of brain and body, offering hypotheses for quantifying various aspects of phenomenology to be tested in future work.

  % Abstract: Human consciousness emerges over time. From the moment of conception, a process of neurodevelopment and complexification begins, generating and supporting a neuroelectric field that can be quantified by computational methods from dynamical systems theory. In the early embryo, genetically driven cellular processes are mediated by endogenous electromagnetic fields and intrinsic electrical fields produced by migrating neurons. In the ambient cellular environment, these interactions influence each other, impacting neural migration. The emergence of Theory of Mind, often considered a hallmark of conscious awareness, is accompanied by increasing neural connectivity, neuroelectric field complexity, and more integrated information processing. Neurodegeneration in old age and the often-associated decline in conscious awareness correlate closely with changes in the dynamical complexity of the neuroelectric field. Monitoring trajectories of the neuroelectric field and its complexity changes through the lifespan presents a developmental perspective and empirical correlation for studying the emergence and decline of human consciousness.

  % Abstract: This article is about the neural conundrum behind the slowness of human behavior. The information throughput of a human being is about 10 bits/s. In comparison, our sensory systems gather data at ∼1⁢09 bits/s. The stark contrast between these numbers remains unexplained and touches on fundamental aspects of brain function: what neural substrate sets this speed limit on the pace of our existence? Why does the brain need billions of neurons to process 10 bits/s? Why can we only think about one thing at a time? The brain seems to operate in two distinct modes: the “outer” brain handles fast high-dimensional sensory and motor signals, whereas the “inner” brain processes the reduced few bits needed to control behavior. Plausible explanations exist for the large neuron numbers in the outer brain, but not for the inner brain, and we propose new research directions to remedy this.

  % Abstract: Theta-band oscillations (3–8 Hz) in the mammalian hippocampus organize the temporal structure of cortical inputs, resulting in a phase code that enables rhythmic input sampling for episodic memory formation and spatial navigation. However, it remains unclear what evolutionary pressures might have driven the selection of theta over higher-frequency bands that could potentially provide increased input sampling resolution. Here, we address this question by introducing a theoretical framework that combines the efficient coding and neural oscillatory sampling hypotheses, focusing on the information rate (bits/s) of phase coding neurons. We demonstrate that physiologically realistic noise levels create a trade-off between the speed of input sampling, determined by oscillation frequency, and encoding precision in rodent hippocampal neurons. This speed-precision trade-off results in a maximum information rate of ∼1–2 bits/s within the theta frequency band, thus confining the optimal oscillation frequency to the low end of the spectrum. We also show that this framework accounts for key hippocampal features, such as the preservation of the theta band along the dorsoventral axis despite physiological gradients, and the modulation of theta frequency and amplitude by running speed. Extending the analysis beyond the hippocampus, we propose that theta oscillations could also support efficient stimulus encoding in the visual cortex and olfactory bulb. More broadly, our framework lays the foundation for studying how system features, such as noise, constrain the optimal sampling frequencies in both biological and artificial brains

  % Abstract: Various neuroscientific theories maintain that brain oscillations are important for neuronal computation, but opposing views claim that these macroscale dynamics are ‘exhaust fumes’ of more relevant processes. Here, we approach the question of whether oscillations are functional or epiphenomenal by distinguishing between measurements and processes, and by reviewing whether causal or inferentially useful links exist between field potentials, electric fields, and neurobiological events. We introduce a vocabulary for the role of brain signals and their underlying processes, demarcating oscillations as a distinct entity where both processes and measurements can exhibit periodicity. Leveraging this distinction, we suggest that electric fields, oscillating or not, are causally and computationally relevant, and that field potential signals can carry information even without causality.

  note = {doi: 10.1016/j.neuron.2021.09.044}
  % Abstract: Information processing in the brain depends on the integration of synaptic input distributed throughout neuronal dendrites. Dendritic integration is a hierarchical process, proposed to be equivalent to integration by a multilayer network, potentially endowing single neurons with substantial computational power. However, whether neurons can learn to harness dendritic properties to realize this potential is unknown. Here, we develop a learning rule from dendritic cable theory and use it to investigate the processing capacity of a detailed pyramidal neuron model. We show that computations using spatial or temporal features of synaptic input patterns can be learned, and even synergistically combined, to solve a canonical nonlinear feature-binding problem. The voltage dependence of the learning rule drives coactive synapses to engage dendritic nonlinearities, whereas spike-timing dependence shapes the time course of subthreshold potentials. Dendritic input-output relationships can therefore be flexibly tuned through synaptic plasticity, allowing optimal implementation of nonlinear functions by single neurons.
